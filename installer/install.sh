# Downloads the release manifest and its signature, checks the signature against the
# release key built into this script, then downloads the installer for this server's
# architecture from the address the manifest names and checks its sha256 against the
# manifest, and starts it with the arguments given after "-s --":
# "... | sudo bash -s -- --join KEY" installs a node of an existing panel.
#
# What the check proves: the manifest and the binary come from whoever holds the release
# key, even if they were served by a mirror, a cache or a stolen GitHub account. What it
# cannot prove: this script is as trustworthy as the place it came from (it carries the
# key), so the first install rests on TLS and on GitHub for the script itself. Every update
# after that is checked by the installer against the key it carries.
